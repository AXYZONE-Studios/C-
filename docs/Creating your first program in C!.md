C! is a concept for a general-purpose programming language inspired by C# and Java. It will focus on GUI development and familiarity, making it easy to pick up for people who already know different languages.

Below is a sample Hello World program written in C!:

```dart
import stdout;

func main()
{
	stdout("Hello World!");
	return 0;
}
```

Here's a line-by-line analysis of the code and its syntax:

`import stdout;` - This line is responsible for importing the `stdout` library, designed for efficiently handling text output. Similar libraries include `stdin` and `stderr`, though, unlike languages like C++, they have to be imported separately.

`func main()` - The `func` keyword initiates a new function, while `main`
is the required name for the main function of a program. Each C! program needs one and only one `main` function

`stdout()` is the main function provided by the `stdout` library. It is the equivalent of C's `printf` function, or Python's `print` function. It accepts one argument: the string or variable you want to display.

`return 0;` - This line is required in every `main` function, as the program needs to return an exit code upon termination, which is exactly what this statement does. Exit code `0` means that the program executed successfully.
